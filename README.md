# Image and Animation Prototype

This prototype is a very basic prototype for testing basic animation and changing images/displaying images
#
### What I learned
- How to display images
- How to change displayed images
- How to do primitive animations/create a primitive video/animation player
#
In the future I hope to use this as a baseline alongside the [Visual Movement Prototype](https://github.com/Nadelio/VMP) to create some sort of 2D or 3D game engine. Could be fun, but I bet it will be very painful first.
